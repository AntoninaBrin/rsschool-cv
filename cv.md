## Something about me
I have been working as illustrator and graphic designer during 4 years. Before that I was studying at college of arts, and before that was a higher medical education (but that's a completely different story). Design has it's own language. I love and know it. 
But now I feel it's time to learn something new and better paid :)



## What about programming?
I don't know any programming language and, as a result, I don't have any code examples. Ok, there are few JS codewar's tasks on my account but I think it's not very appropriate to use it as an example of written code.


## Do I know English?
My level is around B1-B2, I think.
