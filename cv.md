## Something about me
I have been working as illustrator and graphic designer during 4 years. Before that I was studying at college of arts, and before that was a higher medical education (but that's a completely different story). Design has it's own language. I love and know it. 
But now I feel it's time to learn something new and better paid :)



## What about programming?
I don't know any programming language and, as a result, I don't have any code examples. Ok, there is a JS codewar's task on my account:

```
function gooseFilter (birds) {
  var geese = ["African", "Roman Tufted", "Toulouse", "Pilgrim", "Steinbacher"];
  
  const noGeese = []
  
  for (const birdsName of birds) {
    if (!geese.includes(birdsName)) {
      noGeese.push(birdsName)
    }
  }
  return noGeese
};
```

## Do I know English?
My level is around B1-B2, I think.
